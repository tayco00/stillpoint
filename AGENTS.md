# work

> A Ruflo-orchestrated, Codex-executed site project

## Quick Start

### Setup
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

### Test
```bash
npm test
```

## Agent Behavior

### Code Standards
- Keep files under 500 lines
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate input at system boundaries
- Use typed interfaces for public APIs

### File Organization
- `/app` - Product source and route files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `/.agents` - Ruflo project configuration and skills

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `$swarm-orchestration` | Multi-agent coordination for complex tasks |
| `$memory-management` | Pattern storage and semantic search |

## Security Rules

- NEVER commit .env files or secrets
- Always validate user inputs
- Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS

## Ruflo + Codex Automated Workflow

Ruflo is the coordination ledger and policy decision point; Codex workers execute code, tests, and commands. A Ruflo coordination call records work but never replaces implementation.

Use `guidance_brain({ mode: "recommend", task: "..." })` when the task can
benefit from Ruflo-specific capabilities. Its live registry is authoritative
for tool presence; registration alone does not prove configuration,
reachability, health, or authorization. If it is not registered, use compatible
`guidance_recommend`, CLI discovery, and repository instructions.

1. **Recall** — search AgentDB memory and relevant ADRs for patterns and constraints.
2. **Inspect** — read source, runtime, dependency, policy, and health state.
3. **Route** — choose the smallest capable topology, agents, skills, and tools.
4. **Plan** — define acceptance criteria, safety envelope, ownership, and validation.
5. **Execute** — Codex workers implement in isolated scopes; Ruflo records coordination.
6. **Test** — run focused tests, regression tests, and failure-path checks.
7. **Validate** — check types, security, policy, compatibility, and artifact integrity.
8. **Benchmark** — compare a source-bound candidate with a source-bound baseline.
9. **Optimize** — improve measured bottlenecks without weakening the safety envelope.
10. **Receipt** — bind claims, evidence, and decisions to exact source/build inputs.
11. **Handoff** — reconcile concurrent work and disclose unresolved limitations.
12. **Publish** — only an independently authorized release gate may publish immutable artifacts.

### Concurrency and authority invariants

- Never allow two writers in one worktree.
- Read-only research agents may share a checkout; writing agents may not.
- A child may drop capabilities but can never add tools, servers, namespaces, network access, spend, concurrency, or delegation depth.
- Cancel dependent and not-yet-started sibling work when policy denies an action or a required dependency fails.
- MetaHarness may benchmark candidates concurrently, but it cannot promote, serve, or expand its own SafetyEnvelope.
- Only the integration agent changes shared manifests or lockfiles.
- Do not auto-commit, push, merge, release, or delete worktrees unless the user authorized that operation.
- Every consequential action must produce a policy decision receipt; production, destructive, spend, and promotion actions may require human approval.

### Repository harness adapter

When tracked repository instructions define a local collaboration harness:

1. Assign the isolated worktree before starting a writing session.
2. Start or register the session, inspect current claims, and acquire only the
   exact paths, resources, and development ports needed for the task.
3. Renew leases during long work, check acknowledged inbox messages at integration
   boundaries, and release claims when handing off or ending.
4. Record focused and integration evidence against the exact source state,
   then let the designated integration owner decide release.

A repository lease coordinates ownership; it does not grant authorization.
In-memory reference adapters demonstrate semantics but are not distributed,
restart-durable release authorities.
The worker still needs the current ADR-324/325 action capability and fencing
epoch for every protected side effect. Heartbeat and lease expiry establish
liveness; a PID is diagnostic only. HEAD alone is not an exact source-state
identity when tracked or untracked changes exist, so a release receipt must
bind a clean commit or an immutable snapshot including those changes.
